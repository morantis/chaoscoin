Chaoscoin is a testing code set based on a fork of Litecoin.  It is intended for experimentation and coding tests and not for a live environment.

You can clone this and play with it, however bear in mind that this coin is never going to be announced, advertised or introduced by us to any market.

We also control this github and do make changes that may make the coin unstable, non-working or bricked from time to time.

Anyone that jumps on this fork and intends to try to use the coin for real-time live altcoin services should either fork this repository, the Litecoin repository or Bitcoin.

Using this code directly and using it for updates can and very likely will result in a complete loss of any value that you have worked into the coin.

That is your choice, please feel free to experiment and play, but do not post changes here if you somehow manage to get control over this git.

Thanks,
Nexxus Unified Holdings
